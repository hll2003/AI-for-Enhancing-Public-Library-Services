# AI for Enhancing Public Library Services

## Summary

Develop an AI-based system to optimize public library services, including book recommendations, resource management, and community engagement. This project aims to improve user satisfaction and operational efficiency in libraries.

## Background

Public libraries face challenges in meeting diverse user needs and managing resources effectively. Problems include:

* **Book Recommendation:** Difficulty in suggesting relevant books based on user preferences.
* **Resource Management:** Inefficient tracking of book loans and returns.
* **Community Engagement:** Limited interaction and engagement with library patrons.

**Personal Motivation:** Libraries are crucial community resources. Enhancing their services through AI can make them more accessible and user-friendly, benefiting communities as a whole.

## How is it used?

The AI system will be used in the following ways:

* **Book Recommendations:** Users receive personalized book suggestions based on their reading history and preferences.
* **Resource Management:** The system automates tracking of book loans and returns, and helps in managing inventory.
* **Community Engagement:** Provides insights into user feedback and engagement trends to improve library services and outreach.

**Context:** The solution will be used in public libraries, both large and small. It should be adaptable to various library sizes and types, and user-friendly for both library staff and patrons.

## Data Sources and AI Methods

**Data Sources:**

* **Library Catalogs:** Data on books, genres, and user loans.
* **User Profiles:** Information on user preferences and borrowing history.
* **Community Feedback:** Surveys and feedback forms from library patrons.

**AI Techniques:**

* **Recommendation Systems:** To suggest books based on user preferences and reading history.
* **Predictive Analytics:** To forecast book demand and optimize inventory management.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** To analyze user feedback and identify trends in community engagement.

```python
# Example code for book recommendation system using collaborative filtering
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Load data
books = pd.read_csv('books.csv')
user_ratings = pd.read_csv('user_ratings.csv')

# Create a matrix of book features
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(books['description'])

# Compute similarity matrix
cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)

def recommend_books(title, cosine_sim=cosine_sim):
    idx = books.index[books['title'] == title].tolist()[0]
    sim_scores = list(enumerate(cosine_sim[idx]))
    sim_scores = sorted(sim_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    sim_scores = sim_scores[1:11]
    book_indices = [i[0] for i in sim_scores]
    return books['title'].iloc[book_indices]

print(recommend_books('The Great Gatsby'))
